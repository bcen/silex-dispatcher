Silex-Dispatcher
----------------

Silex-Dispatcher pretends to be a RESTful framework that built on top of
[Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/).
It is inspired by [django-tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie)
(No, not really, no inspiration,I tried to copy django-tastypie line by line).


Installation
============

Via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

    {
        "require": {
            "bcen/silex-dispatcher": "0.1.*"

    }
